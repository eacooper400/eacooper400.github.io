<h2 id="rcodingfortheanalysisofsnpdataandappliedpopulationgenetics">R coding for the analysis of SNP data and applied population genetics</h2>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>

<p>High-throughput sequencing technology has made it possible to obtain large scale genetic data sets for almost any organism, creating a need for computational tools and skill sets to process these data.  While the bioinformatics workflows for processing raw data into SNPs are typically well delineated, the path for analyzing and interpreting the resulting SNP data set can be less clear.  Classical population genetics theory is a rich field with many existing statistics and mathematical models, all created to draw biological inferences from nothing more than the patterns of observed gene and allele frequencies.  Since these frequencies can be calculated from any SNP data set, this makes them highly applicable to current research.  In this workshop, students will learn about statistics that test the neutral theory, and then apply the test to a sample SNP data set.  Throughout this process, students will learn to write their own R code for each analysis, and emphasis will be placed on algorithm design with scalability for large data sets in mind.  </p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Achieve a thorough understanding of each statistic or model, especially in terms of neutral theory expectations, and interpretations of deviations from the neutral expectation.  Emphasis will also be placed on knowing when a certain model may or may not be appropriate for a particular data set or scenario.</li>

<li>Make the connection between the table of genotypes obtained in a VCF file (standard next-gen pipeline output) and a theoretical equation that comes from a textbook or paper.  By writing their own code each week, students will get a feel for the best ways to set up algorithms by dividing tasks into re-usable functions, parsing difficult file structures, and creating useful output.  </li>

<li>Learn (or improve) R programming skills with hands-on practice.  For each exercise, we will focus on writing code from scratch (rather than using pre-existing packages), so that students will become familiar with common coding structures such as functions and loops.  These skills are applicable to all coding languages, rather than being R specific.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h3>

<ul>
<li>GEN 3000 or an equivalent undergrad genetics course from another institution.  Students must have a working knowledge of the basic concepts of genetics, including Mendelian inheritance and the molecular basis of heredity.  Prior knowledge of population genetics is NOT required.</li>

<li>ALL LEVELS OF PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE ARE WELCOME! This course is designed for both biologists who want to learn bioinformatics, and for people with programming experience who want to learn more about biology or population genomics.</li>

<li>In previous semesters, some students who were completely new to R found it helpful to also go through an online tutorial of R to get more comfortable with it in the beginning.  They recommended <img src="http://nathanieldphillips.com/thepiratesguidetor/" alt="this one" /> in particular.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="generalstructure">General Structure:</h3>

<ul>
<li>1-3 credits; Grades assigned based on participation (70%) and final project (30%)</li>

<li>Meet 1 time per week, for 2.5 hours
++  First 30-45 minutes: Review results or questions from the previous week.  Then, discuss one key test statistic/concept; go over in detail the meaning, derivation, assumptions, and expectations of the central model or statistic for the week.
++  1.5 hours: Briefly discuss algorithm for implementing the model in a VCF file, then everyone will work on their code while interacting with the instructor and the other students for assistance and feedback*. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>The exact amount of time devoted to lecture vs. in-class programming will change from week to week, depending on what the topic is.  Additionally, some weeks the in-class exercise may not take the full amount of time, while other exercises might span into the next week of class.</em></p>
